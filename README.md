# The-Pokémon-Database
This is the final project that we created for the course CS-486/586: INTRO TO DATABASE under the professor "Kristin Tufte".

## Outline

The database idea is inspired by the 90’s popular cartoon TV show Pokemon (short for “Pocket Monsters”) created by Nintendo. In this imaginative world, there are two main entities, Number one are the pokemons which are quirky monsters found throughout the world. They belong to a particular type (water, grass, fire, etc) and have their own unique skill set and statistics. The other entity are the trainers who travel to different places and try to capture these pokemon and put them in battle against other trainer’s pokemon. This helps them to gain monetary benefits as well as gym badges that help them to become the very best pokemon trainer in the world.
The database would be a replica of an item shown in the TV show called “Pokédex” which stores all the information about the pokemon, their types, moves and locations at which they are seen. As the TV show has become severely popular and has many different seasons, many new pokemons have been created.
But for this project, we will be focusing on the original 151 pokemons which are found in the Kanto region and the database would revolve around the Generation I games (Red/Blue/Yellow) based on these 151 pokemons. (Some table examples include Pokemon, Trainer, moves, types, pokemon_location, pokemon_evolution_chain, etc)

## Table Information 
There are total 10 tables in the Pokemon Database, those are :

Pokemon - The main table that contains details of all the Pokemons

Type - The domain table that stores details regarding different types that exist in the Pokemon world.

Pokemon_Types - This table provides information about the type that each Pokemon belongs to. Ex. Bulbasaur is a grass type as well as poison type Pokemon

Pokemon_Evolutions - This table stores information about Pokemon’s prevolution

Trainer_Class - This table stores information about different Trainer AI’s present in the game.
